            <p class="text-justify">
                Over the last few decades, economic transformations in Western societies have significantly reshaped the ways we produce, consume, and perceive the world around us. In this evolving landscape, the extreme rise of Machine Learning has been <b>celebrated as a groundbreaking technological revolution</b>. The tools of this framework, applied across an ever-expanding array of fields, promise unmatched efficiency and innovation. Yet, they also provoke unease. Many view these advancements as a double-edged sword, a marvel of modern science but a potential threat to historically considered human-centric skills and professions, particularly those that thrive on <b>individuality</b> and <b>creativity</b>. This duality leads us to grapple with two pressing questions: how do these technologies truly influence our cultural and economic practices, and more critically, what do these shifts reveal about our society's relationship with what we consume and consider worth, when it is about creativity and self-expression?
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The term <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> has saturated public discourse, often presented as both a miracle and a menace. Its influence stretches across industries, altering workflows and redefining roles in ways that professionals sometimes find unsettling. Writing offers a clear example: tools like ChatGPT seem to challenge traditional conceptions of authorship. But redaction is just the tip of the iceberg, the most mediatised and visible part of the change.  Visual arts seem to have been reshaped by tools like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, and music shows similar disruptions with innovations like Suno or Riffusion. These technologies signal a shift not just in what is created but in <b>what we consider important in the act of creation</b> itself.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                What unites these tools is their focus on <b>generating tangible results</b>, artifacts or outputs that meet <b>specific, measurable criteria</b>. This production process departs from traditional creative workflows, instead relying on statistical prediction and algorithmic manipulation. Human creativity, inherently complex and iterative, is distilled into streamlined processes optimized for efficiency and quantifiable precision. Such mechanisms prioritize outcome over method, fundamentally altering how value is ascribed to the creative act. While efficient, this shift raises profound questions: are we compromising the depth of creative processes in favor of surface-level outcomes? What does this say about a society that increasingly prizes quantifiable metrics over subjective experiences?
            </p>

			<p class="text-justify">
                Increasingly, we evaluate Art through a lens of quantifiable attributes. A text is praised for its vocabulary diversity and grammatical accuracy, a painting for its precise details, and a musical performance for adhering to technical standards. This systematic approach plays directly into the strengths of AI, which is engineered to optimize such criteria. As a result, algorithms <b>often outperform humans in producing <i>technically perfect</i> outputs</b>. But does technical precision alone capture the soul of a creative work? By reducing artistic value to numeric parameters, we risk prioritizing conformity over individuality and innovation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Let us examine again ChatGPT, this language model that constructs sentences by predicting the next most probable word or phrase. Unlike human writers, who meticulously plan and refine their work, this tool lacks an overarching understanding of context, intent, or thematic unity. Image generation models function similarly, translating random noise into coherent visuals without grasping artistic concepts like symbolism or emotional resonance. Musical AI tools follow suit, stitching together sequences of sound without an inherent sense of harmony or rhythm. These processes prioritize functionality over artistry, <b>evaluating success by metrics like grammatical coherence, image fidelity, or rhythmical accuracy</b>. But when creativity is reduced to measurable output, we must ask: does this reflect the essence of human expression or the utilitarian values of our productivity-driven culture?
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                This obsession with results is deeply rooted in the broader economic and social frameworks of contemporary Western society. Metrics like GDP, productivity rates, and market indices dominate our understanding of success and progress. While such measures are vital <b>in fields like science and engineering</b>, their influence on the arts is more contentious. Here, the imposition of quantitative benchmarks can distort the purpose of creation, <b>favoring algorithms designed to excel at these evaluations</b> while marginalizing human creators who may prioritize meaning over measurability.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                This raises a critical question: should the value of Art be confined to its observable results, or can it encompass intangible qualities? True Art often defies metrics, capturing philosophical musings, emotional depth, and cultural aspects. These elements, rooted in lived experience and personal insight, remain inaccessible to current AI systems. <b>Especially, those are not always contained in the tangible product.</b> Painting, writing, or composing is as much about the journey as the destination, a process steeped in experimentation, reflection, and the pursuit of human connection. These dimensions are crucial to preserving the integrity of the creative process.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                If we acknowledge that Art is more than its final form, society must rethink how it evaluates creative works. This shift isn't limited to artists: it demands a collective reassessment by audiences, critics, and institutions. Do we seek standardized, consumable content, or do we value something else? This introspection could pave the way for richer cultural experiences, where <b>diversity of expression outweighs mere technical finesse</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Artists have a pivotal role in this transformation. To remain relevant in a world where algorithms excel at producing results, they must embrace what machines cannot replicate. However, this shift also relies on audiences <b>valuing these other qualities</b>. If we reduce Art to mere consumables, we risk accelerating AI's dominance over the creative realm. Instead, society must celebrate the elements of creation that resist commodification.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Rethinking our relationship with Art is no small task: it requires a fundamental shift in societal values. Yet, it also offers an unprecedented opportunity to safeguard what makes us feel human: the ability to express complex ideas, multiple emotions, in philosophical, cultural and social context. By placing greater emphasis on these <b>immeasurable qualities</b>, we can ensure that Art continues to reflect the richness of the human spirit.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Researchers, particularly those in artistic AI, bear a responsibility here as well. By relentlessly chasing quantifiable success, they risk <b>reinforcing society's preference for technical perfection</b> over emotional resonance. A more balanced approach could guide AI development toward complementing rather than competing with human creativity.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Ultimately, Artificial Intelligence has the potential to become a valuable ally in the artistic domain. By excelling at tasks like technical refinement and production efficiency, AI can free artists from logistical constraints, allowing them to focus on what truly defines creativity: the expression of subjectivity, the pursuit of the unexpected, and the embodiment of shared humanity. In this <b>symbiotic relationship</b>, AI wouldn't overshadow human creators but instead <b>empower them</b>, unlocking new possibilities for <b>Art</b> and <b>Culture</b> to evolve in tandem with technology.
