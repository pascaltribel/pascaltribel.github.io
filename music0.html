			<h2>Is Music only about Math ?</h2>
			<hr class="my-4">
			<p class="text-left>
				During the last years, a lot of effort has been made in computer sciences to try to apprehend music as it has been done for language. 
				Most of the attempts of replication of human musical creativity are now made through the looking-glass of extreme mathematisation and formalisation of the musical language.
				This is often done without daring the first delve into the decades, if not centuries, of artistic research and reflexion that has been made on the musical language, preferring to barely imitate the misunderstood surface of the Western tonal music.
			</p>
			<p class="text-left">
				The fact that some people perceive music primarily through the lens of mathematics, statistics, and models does not mean that music is merely a direct application of probabilistic processes. 
        In my view, this perspective only indicates that such individuals may have an overly strong tendency to analyze the world around them through a ethnocentric logical-scientific framework.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        This notion, though not new, is rooted in the modern era's inheritance of the <i>human-machine</i> concept, which emerged in the 19th century in the West. 
        It has likely deformed even our most personal perceptions, altering our relationship to music and art in general. 
        However, connections between music and the arts in the West date back much earlier: the Pythagoreans revered music as the language of the Universe, seeing it as a translation of mathematical principles. 
        Yet, even then, this view of music stemmed from a bias toward a perhaps overly reverent view of mathematics. 
        The mathematical approach to composition in that era, however, was <i>fundamentally different</i> from what we see today; it was used to left and construct musical theory, not as a tool for creating artistic works.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        With the rise of <b>Generative Artificial Intelligence</b> and the statistical hypotheses it involves, the notion of creation as a logical-mathematical process has been strongly reinforced in Western artistic consumption habits, or at least within scientific research addressing artistic questions. 
        However, Western musical language, which has been greatly enriched since the late 19th century by observing and studying non-Western cultural productions, and by the realization that artistic absolutes do not exist—especially after the two World Wars—has now been significantly impoverished by the algorithmic and statistical need to adhere to rules that can be encoded on a machine
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        The advent of Machine Learning revived the 19th-century concept of the <i>artist-genius</i>, but distorted it by considering such individuals as highly performant <i>supercomputers</i>. 
        This has led to the flawed reasoning that <i>supercomputers</i> could be <i>artist-geniuses</i>, and by extension, <i>artists</i>. 
        This reinterpretation was only made possible by researchers establishing mathematical criteria to evaluate artistic quality. 
        By comparing algorithms to artists based on these mathematical criteria (with few alternative evaluation methods), the scientific community has become complacent in the belief that algorithms can increasingly approximate the output of human artists. 
        This reasoning is tautological: if both artists and algorithms are assessed using criteria that are not particularly valid for determining artistic quality (<i>if such a concept even exists—an assumption rarely questioned in scientific publications</i>), it is unsurprising that algorithms perform comparably to their human counterparts. 
        Evaluating algorithmic success by its popularity with the public is, in my opinion, an unreliable measure, given how these algorithms are heavily utilized in mainstream music production, skewing listeners' consumption habits and judgment criteria.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        <i>I do not, however, claim that humans are unique in their creative abilities</i>; I acknowledge that other systems might achieve similar results through entirely different means. 
        Nevertheless, I am convinced that the scientific, logical, and mathematical approach increasingly promoted by contemporary computational developments is misguided and more damaging than beneficial. 
        As is unfortunately too often the case in Machine Learning research, results that appear spectacular can blind both researchers and the public, who may overlook the importance of critically evaluating the value and quality of the content produced. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        The outcome, in my opinion, is a significant regression, which disregards decades of artistic, philosophical, epistemological, and cultural inquiry by prioritizing models and hypotheses over observation and critical thought.
